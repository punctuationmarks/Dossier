# **Note, beta stage currently, needs to be refactored and layout needs to be tightened.**

# Dossier app
- Simple note taking app to give yourself reminders on the people you meet and jot notes down through out the day.
- Features:
	- Download and upload any model you'd like with a .csv file (can easily be expanded to other formats as well)
	- Accessible friendly with skip links, alt tags, and color scheme changer (with easy customization with CSS variables)
	- Simple with the fewest dependencies with a Django app, so less chance of something breaking
	- Can host this on Heroku or AWS for free and have your own private note taker
		- Or since Heroku is owned by SalesForce and AWS by Amazon and you fear they're mining your databases,
			throw it on Linode or DigitalOcean for fairly cheap. Want an even better challenge?
			Toss it on an old laptop you're not using, Ubuntu Server is pretty amazing. :)
